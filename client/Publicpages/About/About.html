                <p class="text-justify">
                    <strong>Digital Yantra Technologies</strong> was started
                        by a team of enthusiastic techpreneurs with vast experience in
                        the IT sector. With the wide variety of IT service offerings
                        being made by different IT companies, it becomes extremely
                        difficult for a customer to choose from the best, considering the
                        iron triangle of cost, quality and time. The core idea behind
                        starting DYT was to offer a one-stop end-to-end solution to the
                        client - starting from process study to final implementation,
                        with utmost care being taken at each step of the project to
                        ensure that the deliverables are in-line with the expectations of
                        the customer. Moreover, at DYT, we adopt a customer centric
                        perspective on all projects that we execute; making us stand out
                        of the competition. This unique selling point has made us the
                        preferred partner of many major IT implementations. Apart from
                        the IT service offerings, we are in the process of developing
                        in-house products that cater to sectors like education and
                        general insurance. <br /> Our vision is to be the most preferred
                        software solution development partner. With core values of
                        integrity and delivering products/solutions of highest quality we
                        are a budding company quickly growing in size. We sincerely
                        believe that a sharp focus on picking latest trends in technology
                        and an eye to detail will help us deliver the best-in-class
                        solutions.
